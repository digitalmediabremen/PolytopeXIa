experiments with lasers?!?

this session got kicked off by lorenz who showed an amazing amount of inspirational works and technologies. he also offered some of xenoramas tech ( e.g projectors, light strips ). he then also showed a way to render visual light in blender using the external renderer [LuxCore](https://luxcorerender.org/). 

this inspired me to wonder how much we want and need simulations ( in general ). how much time we want to spend crafting them? but also: how do they influence our design process? ( xenakis did not have many means of simulating his works ).

we then discussed some more aspects of xenakis work. how close do we want to stay to the original work? what would a super straight forward approch look like? how would xenakis design a polytope today? #WWXD? what kind of recent technologies would he apply?

> @idea(take a xenakis text translate it through multiple ML-translations into at least 7 different languages and then produce the work according to the translated concept text) 

xenakis is also talking a lot about interactivity and how the artwork is only realized in the audiences head.

> @what_if( we would use the mobile phones of the audience to create light sources? ( e.g a custom made lenses that can be attached to people’s telephone flashlights ) )

we then got around to playing around with some laser diodes ( point shapes, line shaped, and cross shaped ):

> @what_if( we would aggresively adapt the *style* of our installation to the given architecture? ( e.g everythings is rectangular ) )

we are going to kick off next session with an approx 10 minute presentation by each student talking about their research ( e.g recherche, text fragements, experiments )
