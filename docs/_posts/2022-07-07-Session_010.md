towards finalizing the *entwurf*

we are still planing to have the following elements:

- grid of CNC-mirrors on stilts related to the architectural 3Ã—3m floor grid
- cobra ( moving-head ) lights shining into the grid
- visitors bring mobile phone that flash randomly or choreographed

we set up a test model of 3 poles with a height of 2.5m and a pitch of 3m to get an idea of the dimensions of the grid:

i have recovered a set of stepper motors: *Nanotec SMCI12 PD2-N4118L1804-2*. 12 motors are working ( 6 have broken controllers and but functioning motors ). thes motors are real nice and real expensive. they can be controlled via a RS485 serial interface which allows a signal cable length of 350 m which is perfect for our needs:

i have also created a simple tool that allows to position ( 3D ) mirror objects in space an cast rays through it. this could be a very nice tool to experiment with procedural configurations:
