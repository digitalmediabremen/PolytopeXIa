we talked about ways to generate *collective* ideas: buckets 

we discussed the problems of generating and deciding on ideas in a group. who decides? and and what basis? 

we decided to implement the ideas of *buckets* in order to make the whole process from generating to deciding on ideas more *horizontal* or how lucca did put it:

> hej fellow students, today in class we were discussing how to approach the process of actually deciding what ideas, concepts and technologies we want to work with and how in the end we choose/vote on what we, finally, go with. we came up with the idea of a whole lot of metaphorical "buckets", which stand for the ideas, concepts and the technologies we want to work with. the plan is that now everyone can contribute something to the buckets they find interesting, their contents can flow into each other and then in the end we can go with the biggest/bestest bucket or pour multiple bucket loads into a bigger pot. you can see and add (to the) buckets we discussed today here: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOvhXbWY=/

## bucket manifesto

- buckets can never be owned
- a bucket is public domain
- the content of a bucket is public domain
- buckets and their contents may be remixed
- buckets are points of crystalization
- buckets are multi-facetted, multi-parametrical and multi-dimensional
- buckets can focus on technology, aethetics and/or concepts
- buckets must be interesting, if they fail to do so they may be ignored

## bucket miro board

@lucca volunteered to setup a dedicated miro board to collect *buckets*. the visual protocol from this session may be used as the first content for the [bucket miro board]([@todo{add_link}](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOvhXbWY=/)):
