we talked about ways to generate *collective* ideas: buckets 

we discussed the problems of generating and deciding on ideas in a group. who decides? and and what basis? 

we decided to implement the ideas of *buckets* in order to make the whole process from generating to deciding on ideas more *horizontal*.

## bucket manifesto

- buckets can never be owned
- a bucket is public domain
- the content of a bucket is public domain
- buckets and their contents may be remixed
- buckets are points of crystalization
- buckets are multi-facetted, multi-parametrical and multi-dimensional
- buckets can focus on technology, aethetics and/or concepts
- buckets must be interesting, if they fail to do so they may be ignored

## bucket miro board

@lucca volunteered to setup a dedicated miro board to collect *buckets*. the visual protocol from this session may be used as the first content for the [bucket miro board](@todo{add_link}):
