we talked about grids, mirrors and mobile phones

slowly but gradually we are converging towards a clearer idea of what will do:

- grid of CNC-mirrors on stilts related to the architectural 3×3m floor grid
- cobra ( moving-head ) lights shining into the grid
- mirrors + lights creating configurations of multiple lines in 
- visitors bring mobile phone that flash randomly or choreographed

## "but what happens under the ceiling?"

kilian asks. well the mirrors on stilts operate on a height of approx 2.5–3.0m and the mobile phones operate on human height. i.e there will not be much going on under the ceiling. however xenakis arranged the flashlight in a grid right under the ceiling. how to deal with this?

one possible solution would be to also install mirrors under the ceiling in order to make mobile phone flash light appear to be hovering under the ceiling when people look up.
