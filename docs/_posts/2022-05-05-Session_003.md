we are still in the free form experimental phase. everyone is doodling around with technology, through research, text and discussions. we will end this phase in 2 weeks with a milestone presentation called *Reality Check*.

## ordering materials

we started this session by talking about ordering materials for experimentations. the following technologies came to mind:

- EL Wires ( simon has some for testing )
- NeoPixels ( there might be a set of neopixel in the [PCLib #086](http://pcl.digitalmedia-bremen.de/) )
- Reflective Foil
- lenses ( for projectors + lasers )
- fibre optics ( aka glasfaser )

the order will be dispatched towards the end of this week.

## how will we document things?

another thing we discussed was how to document our ideas. currently some people are using the [miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO7RWM90=/). however, at some point we will need to find a way to *boil things down* a bit.

## statements

we went on discussing some ideas and some thoughts on xenakis and our contribution. here are some random statements that were uttered along the discussion:

- lucca: "go punk!!! everything everywhere all the time"
- janusz: "let s find constraints"
- xiangyu: "the dark room is like a canvas"
- yan: "one element contradicts another"

## questions

while we were talking about things some questions came to mind:

- what light sources can we controlled? and how? ( e.g lasers on motors, moving heads, articulated projector light )
- what role does the audience play? can they be integrated? programmed? controlled?
- what about probabilities? randomness? ( xenakis keeps on talking about it as a fundamental compositional method )
- should we make the performance *really* intense? ( not just acoustically but also visually? )
- how does our work relate to the xenakis piece?
- what about the notation? ( can we develop our own? or reinterpret xenakisâ€™ )

## experiments

we then started doing some experiments with mirror ball, EL-Wire, smoke and laser projector:

### smoke + laser projector

## concept sketches

for next time everyone is asked to produce some first concept ideas sketches based on research and experiments so far: 

> impress us with a somewhat coherent idea ( incl technology feasibility + financial estimate ). make it convincing!

here are a few rough ones based on the ideas we discussed today:
