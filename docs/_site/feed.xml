experiments with lasers?!?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this session got kicked off by lorenz who showed an amazing amount of inspirational works and technologies. he also offered some of xenoramas tech ( e.g projectors, light strips ). he then also showed a way to render visual light in blender using the external renderer &lt;a href=&quot;https://luxcorerender.org/&quot;&gt;LuxCore&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this inspired me to wonder how much we want and need simulations ( in general ). how much time we want to spend crafting them? but also: how do they influence our design process? ( xenakis did not have many means of simulating his works ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we then discussed some more aspects of xenakis work. how close do we want to stay to the original work? what would a super straight forward approch look like? how would xenakis design a polytope today? #WWXD? what kind of recent technologies would he apply?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;@idea(take a xenakis text translate it through multiple ML-translations into at least 7 different languages and then produce the work according to the translated concept text)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;xenakis is also talking a lot about interactivity and how the artwork is only realized in the audiences head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;@what_if( we would use the mobile phones of the audience to create light sources? ( e.g a custom made lenses that can be attached to people’s telephone flashlights ) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we then got around to playing around with some laser diodes ( point shapes, line shaped, and cross shaped ):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2022-04-28-Session_002/x-blanket.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;@what_if( we would aggresively adapt the &lt;em&gt;style&lt;/em&gt; of our installation to the given architecture? ( e.g everythings is rectangular ) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we are going to kick off next session with an approx 10 minute presentation by each student talking about their research ( e.g recherche, text fragements, experiments )&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>dennisppaul</name></author><summary type="html">experiments with lasers?!?</summary></entry></feed>
